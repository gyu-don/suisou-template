# suisou

A Docker Compose-based sandbox environment for [Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/).

Unlike similar projects such as OpenShell, suisou favors simplicity by relying on familiar Docker tooling for interacting with sandbox containers.

## Architecture

The environment is defined in `compose.yml` with the following services:

- **open-webui** — the Open WebUI container. Shares the `wg-client` network namespace (`network_mode: "service:wg-client"`), so all its outbound traffic flows through the WireGuard tunnel.
- **wg-client** — a WireGuard client that establishes a tunnel to the router and enforces a kill-switch via iptables. The kill-switch blocks all outbound traffic except through the tunnel, preventing the application from bypassing the proxy. The Open WebUI container has no `NET_ADMIN` capability, so it cannot alter these firewall rules.
- **router** — mitmproxy in WireGuard mode (`--mode wireguard`). Terminates the WireGuard tunnel, intercepts all HTTP/HTTPS traffic transparently, and enforces a service-based domain + HTTP-method allowlist (`router/config.toml`). Replaces `SUISOU__*` credential markers in outbound requests with real values from its own environment.
