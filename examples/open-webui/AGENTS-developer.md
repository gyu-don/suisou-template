# Developer Guide

## Language

Use English for all code, configuration files, and documentation.

## Documentation Principles

- Do not duplicate information that is already expressed in code or configuration files.
- If a doc restates what a file already shows, remove the duplication and point to the file instead.

## Version Control

This project uses [jj](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/) for version control.

- **Record granularity**: one change per logical unit (a feature, a fix, or a config change). Don't bundle unrelated changes.
- **Commit messages**: imperative mood, one-line summary. Add a body only when the "why" isn't obvious from the diff. Examples:
  - `Add ollama endpoint to router allowlist`
  - `Fix credential injection for WebSocket payloads`
  - `Separate project and local settings`

## Verification

Always run at minimum:

```sh
docker compose config -q   # validate compose.yml syntax
```

When `compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, or entrypoint scripts change, also:

```sh
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs router --tail=20
```

When changes affect routing, allowlist enforcement, or credential injection, also
run an end-to-end policy check against the live stack. If the environment is
managed by Doppler, use `doppler run -- docker compose ...` for these commands.

Required checks:

- Allowed outbound traffic still succeeds. Example: a `GET` to an allowlisted
  HTTPS domain such as `https://github.com/` returns `200`.
- Blocked outbound traffic is still denied. Example: a `GET` to a non-allowlisted
  HTTPS domain such as `https://example.com/` returns `403`.
- Credential injection only expands the env vars explicitly allowed for the
  matched service or host.
- Markers for env vars that are not allowed for that service or host remain
  unchanged.

These checks are mandatory for changes to `router/addon.py`, `router/config.toml`,
`compose.yml`, `wg-client/`, and sandbox entrypoint or networking logic. They are
part of the project's core security boundary, not optional smoke tests.

## Project Layout

```
compose.yml          # Service definitions (open-webui, wg-client, router)
wg-client/           # WireGuard client container (tunnel + kill-switch)
references/          # Optional local reference material (not tracked upstream)
```

The `references/` directory is reserved for optional local reference material. Do not rely on its contents being present in a fresh clone.

## Coding Style

- Keep configuration minimal and explicit.
- Prefer standard Docker / Compose idioms over custom abstractions.
